'The course' is referring to BV1. Other considerations probably apply for the other courses.

# Benefits of Python
    Lots of available material for students to study programming on their own
    A full-blown programming language
    More useful for students in the future
    Free and open
    Better as a first language?
    A better brand than Matlab?

# Drawbacks of Python
    Not as interactive as Matlab, Figures for example.
    No native GUI, might be solved with Spyder
    A full-blown programming language?
    Unless an IDE is used students will have to get comfortable with the command line
    Will not fix many of the problems with the course

# Questions to answer and think about to inform the decision
    Do we want a programming language or a calculator
        Matlab probably better as a calculator
        What should the students learn?

    What are the goals of the course and why?
        Learn how to use Matlab as a calculator?
        Learn how to program?
        Learn about scientific computing?

    What are the requirements from other courses?

# Random thought
    The course is trying to fit two concepts
        Matlab as a calculator without knowledge about errors, order of accuracy ...
        Programming and Scientific computing

# Setup
    Download anaconda

# Example
    Tim
        Very similar to Matlab

    Jonatan
        Function, several in one file
        namespaces
        Example of anonymous functions

# Other notes
    ndarray vs matrix
        all operations on arrays are element wise <3
        functions for dot products and matrix products
        There is also a specific matrix type (not recommended?)

# Notebooks
    For labs or reports
    Also available for Matlab
